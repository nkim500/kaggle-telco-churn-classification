### [Telco Churn Classification from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn/data)

In this repository, I classify customer churn using a hypothetical dataset from a California-based telecom company, as part of a Kaggle competition.

Customer churn is associated with loss of future revenue, while efforts to retain them may be associated with different costs, such as promotion or labor costs to improve existing services. Under this assumption, the classification task herein focuses on F1 score to strike a balance between recall and precision.

The first notebook [01-EDA](01-EDA.ipynb) covers exploratory data analysis and data transformation.

The second notebook [02-classification](02-classification.ipynb) focuses on training classification models.
